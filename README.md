A directory of my contribution to the Summer Science Program 2020

## Background

In summer 2020, I participated in the Summer Science Program at Purdue University as a Biochemistry research intern. I collaborated with 2 students to design experiments and the protein structure of the next-generation inhibitor against Verticillium Longisporum. 

## Subdirectory details
- Dashboard contains all the visualization dashboards I have created to assist my team in analyzing our wet lab data and determine the next steps in our research. It was thanks to these dashboards that we were able to design our assay experiments, pick our homology model, and optimize it to -6.44 kcal/mol.
- Substrate Identification contains the code that screens more than 5000 sequences to aid in the substrate identification process.
